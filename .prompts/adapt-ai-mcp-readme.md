# Task Context: Adapt AI MCP Readme

---

## 1. üìö Task Definition

**Problem Statement / Goal:**  
Adapt the README file in the packages/ai-mcp-server directory so that it accurately describes and reflects the current available functionality and code structure. The current README does not match the actual implementation.

**Scope:**  
- **In Scope:**  
  - Updating the README content in packages/ai-mcp-server to reflect current code features, commands, endpoints, etc.
  - Ensuring consistency between the code and description in the readme.
- **Out of Scope:**  
  - Modifying the actual code in the ai-mcp-server package.

## 2. üß† Design and Implementation

**Design Overview:**  
Review the existing code in packages/ai-mcp-server, identify the available functionality, commands, endpoints and features. Update the README file content to mirror the actual code base without modifying the behavior of the code.

**Implementation Plan:**  
1. Review the current code in packages/ai-mcp-server to identify features and functionalities.  
2. Extract key details such as available commands, endpoints, and description of operations from the code.  
3. Rewrite the README content to match the actual implementations in the code.  
4. Validate that the adapted README accurately reflects the current code base structure and behavior.

**Technology Choices:**  
- Markdown for the README documentation.
- Manual code review for functionality extraction.

## 3. üß™ Testing

### 3.1 üõ†Ô∏è Automated Testing (by Coder)

**Automated Test Strategy:**  
Manual verification of README content against code functionalities (no automated tests for documentation).

**Test Cases Implemented:**  
- Validate that all described commands/endpoints in the README exist in the code.

**Test Coverage Targets:**  
N/A

### 3.2 üéØ Manual Testing (by Tester)

**Manual Testing Strategy:**  
- Verify the consistency of the README content with actual available code features.

**Test Setup Instructions:**  
- Open the README file and cross-check features with files in packages/ai-mcp-server.

**Test Cases / Steps:**  
1. Read the updated README.  
2. Compare the described functionalities with the code in packages/ai-mcp-server.

**Expected Results:**  
- The README accurately describes the available functionalities and matches the current code.

**Known Risks / Focus Areas:**  
- Misalignment between code changes and README content may require iterative adjustments.
